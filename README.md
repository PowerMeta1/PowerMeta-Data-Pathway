Client Diligence
10. Who are your target clients?:
Individuals learning about Filecoin, Small-scale developers or data owners, Enterprise Data Clients, Other (specified above)

11. Describe in as much detail as possible how you will perform due diligence on clients. If you are proposing an automated pathway, what diligence mechanism will you use to determine client eligibility?:
Due diligence checks are upheld to the utmost standard at Power Meta Corp.
Our process can be simplified to three key steps.

#1: A Comprehensive Data Review
#2: Identifying Storage Providers
#3: KYC Process

We first review the data to ensure its integrity by evaluating it on several characteristics such as general compliance, ownership, public disclosure, copyright, and more. After we review all the data, we require clients to provide all storage providers’ addresses to ensure they’re compliant with our standards based on the Filecoin guidelines in terms of retrievability and diverse geolocation. Once a thorough review of the data and their storage providers is conducted, we examine the results of the KYB/KYC process where we then ask the client to complete a supplementary questionnaire to further gain insight in regards to their storage request. Once completion of our initial check, we add the client’s request to our CRM (via Google Spreadsheets) where we keep track of key information such as the requested amount of DataCap, Storage Provider information, any ongoing status items, and other details. This CRM allows us to continually manage and check in on any ongoing requests to ensure Datacap allocation is being used as intended and all issues that arise are dealt with.

12. Please specify how many questions you’ll ask, and provide a brief overview of the questions.:
We ask around 30 questions where we ask questions regarding who the DataCap applicant is and their relation to the Project, general Project details, the Organization’s details, a description of the data, how the data was prepared, how frequently they plan to retrieve the data, how long the data will be stored, and the geographic distribution of the data are all relevant question topics.

13. Will you use a 3rd-party Know your client (KYC) service?:
Power Meta Corp will enable a 3rd-party KYB/KYC service through Diro.io as an additional measure to verify the client’s dataset’s integrity. For private or enterprise data, they will also need to provide identification such as proof of license or other documentation to validate legitimacy.

14. Can any client apply to your pathway, or will you be closed to only your own internal clients? (eg: bizdev or self-referral):
Any client is welcome to work with us and we do not provide any “white label” services to ensure objectivity within the Filecoin Ecosystem.

15. How do you plan to track the rate at which DataCap is being distributed to your clients?:
Power Meta Corp will use open-source tools provided by Filecoin to track datacap distribution. Also through our own KYC/KYB process, determine the historical usage of datacap within the client’s previous Filecoin history. In addition, we have developed our own CRM (via Google Spreadsheets) that will enable us to keep track of previously allocated DataCap and allow us to stay on top of any status items occurring with any request.

Data Diligence
16. As an operating entity in the Filecoin Community, you are required to follow all local & regional regulations relating to any data, digital and otherwise. This may include PII and data deletion requirements, as well as the storing, transmit:
Acknowledge

17. What type(s) of data would be applicable for your pathway?:
Public Open Dataset (Research/Non-Profit), Public Open Commercial/Enterprise, Private Commercial/Enterprise, Private Non-Profit/Social Impact, Other (specified elsewhere)

18. How will you verify a client’s data ownership? Will you use 3rd-party KYB (know your business) service to verify enterprise clients?:
As mentioned earlier, Power Meta Corp. prides itself on conducting comprehensive data reviews to adhere to any laws when evaluating and storing any data request within the Filecoin ecosystem. We will first identify the client to verify the entity owns the data through license verification and looking for any watermarks within the data. Diro.io will be used as an additional 3rd-party KYB service that we deploy on top of our own KYB/KYC questionnaire.

19. How will you ensure the data meets local & regional legal requirements?:
We ask that clients’ data and storage requests comply with their respective legal requirements before submitting a Datacap Request. When conducting our data review and KYC process, we will first identify the location of the client/storage providers and verify the legal requirements on a local and regional level. After identifying the location of the data and where the data would be stored, we will conduct our due diligence to make sure we are abiding by the legal framework within the countries involved. Our general guidelines prevent us from accepting any data that can be considered illegal or inadmissible by most countries. After conducting our data review with data sampling and upon approval of our own KYB/KYC process, we ask that clients encrypt their data. We will deny any applications that do not meet the legal requirements and will assist clients depending on the severity of the issue to ensure they meet any legal standards outlined by their respective countries.

20. What types of data preparation will you support or require?:
Although we’re not a data preparer, we can provide data prechecks to ensure their data can be properly onboarded as well as pass any verifications needed to be approved for Datacap.

21. What tools or methodology will you use to sample and verify the data aligns with your pathway?:
We will conduct two data checks as a measure to ensure the data aligns with our pathway. The first occurs before DataCap approval where customers are required to provide the data download path for conducting sample checks on the data. The second will occur post-encapsulation where we will randomly retrieve data from customer nodes for sample checks on the data.

Data Distribution
22. How many replicas will you require to meet programmatic requirements for distribution?:
3+

23. What geographic or regional distribution will you require?:
Depending on the application (ie. LDN or EFIL+), we will have separate requirements. For LDN, we prefer 5 physical locations, but the minimum is at least 4 physical locations. For EFIL+, we require at least 2 physical locations as outlined within their original storage request. We will only exclude certain geopolitical regions in accordance with any local or regional law that prevents the storage of the client's data on a case-by-case basis as deemed necessary within our KYB/KYC process.

24. How many Storage Provider owner/operators will you require to meet programmatic requirements for distribution?:
2+

25. Do you require equal percentage distribution for your clients to their chosen SPs? Will you require preliminary SP distribution plans from the client before allocating any DataCap?:
We prefer to distribute Datacap equally to all chosen Storage Providers to ensure equal opportunity for Datacap and to provide an incentive to bolster the strength of the Filecoin Network. Unless otherwise noted or requested by the client, we can make exceptions in distributing the Datacap as outlined by the client’s wishes as long as it abides by Filecoin’s Guidelines. Clients are required to outline their own distribution plan if they prefer to distribute Datacap into different percentages.

26. What tooling will you use to verify client deal-making distribution?:
In order to verify client deal-making distribution, we will analyze the allocation status and transaction proposal information of Datacap for a client address through datacapstats.io as well as the CID checker bot.

27. How will clients meet SP distribution requirements?:
We will abide by the allocation scheme for II+ LDN that can be found on github (https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets#applying-for-a-large-datacap-allocation). For clients who are requesting Datacap for data that exceeds 100 TiB, we recommend that the clients abide by Filecoin’s best practices for storing large datasets. The client will ideally store the data within three or more regions, with four or more storage providers, and maintain at least five copies of the dataset. A single Storage Provider should not store more than one copy, and if data cannot leave a specific geographic boundary, replication is expected to occur in different locations. Each storage provider should not exceed 30% of the total data cap allocated for clients, and storage providers should disclose their public IP addresses.

28. As an allocator, do you support clients that engage in deal-making with SPs utilizing a VPN?:
Our clients can use VPNs as long as they are not intentionally using VPNs to mask fraudulent activities. When abuse of their VPN usage is suspected, the burden of proof is shared by the respective storage provider and collaborating applicant. Through our own KYB/KYC process, we require storage providers to provide proof of their company and location to prevent intentional hiding of location or identity using Virtual Private Networks (VPN). This also ensures that the data is not encapsulated in data centers outside of specific regions. is supported for security purposes, which also aligns with the idea of web3.

DataCap Allocation Strategy
29. Will you use standardized DataCap allocations to clients?:
Yes, standardized

30. Allocation Tranche Schedule to clients::
Power Meta Crop will follow the existing allocation guidelines:
First Allocation: 5% of the requested DataCap total or 50% of the weekly allocation rate, whichever is smaller. Second Allocation: 10% of the requested DataCap total or 100% of the weekly allocation rate, whichever is smaller.
Third Allocation: 20% of the requested DataCap total or 200% of the weekly allocation rate, whichever is smaller.
Fourth Allocation: 40% of the requested DataCap total or 400% of the weekly allocation rate, whichever is smaller.
Subsequent Allocations: 80% of the requested DataCap total or 800% of the weekly allocation rate, whichever is smaller.

31. Will you use programmatic or software based allocations?:
Yes, standardized and software based

32. What tooling will you use to construct messages and send allocations to clients?:
We will utilize the existing notary registry tooling made available through Filecoin at https://filplus.fil.org/#/

33. Describe the process for granting additional DataCap to previously verified clients.:
With Power Meta Corp.’s extensive data reviews and our KYB/KYC verification, we have established our own CRM Database that effectively tracks previous Datacap requests. Information such as their Filecoin addresses, previous Datacap requests, and historical evaluations of data samples will be used to establish a baseline status of how reputable a client is. This allows us to keep track of bad actors who repeatedly continue to violate Filecoin’s guidelines. Once a previously verified client makes a new storage request, we will continue with our process of conducting an extensive data review, identifying storage providers, and examining their KYB/KYC verification with our survey completion. Since they are a previous client, they should have no difficulty completing our previous checks.

34. Describe in as much detail as possible the tools used for: • client discoverability & applications • due diligence & investigation • bookkeeping • on-chain message construction • client deal-making behavior • tracking overall allocator health • disput:
